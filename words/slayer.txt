1. Angel Of Death

[Lyrics & Music - Hanneman]

Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life
Forced in
Like cattle
You run
Stripped of
Your life's worth
Human mice, for the Angel of Death
Four hundred thousand more to die
Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Sadistic, surgeon of demise
Sadist of the noblest blood

Destroying, without mercy
To benefit the Aryan race

Surgery, with no anesthesia
Feel the knife pierce you intensely
Inferior, no use to mankind
Strapped down screaming out to die
Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher,
Angel of Death

Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh, drips away
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
Frigid cold, cracks your limbs
How long can you last
In this frozen water burial?
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time
'Til you rip yourselves apart
Millions laid out in their
Crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve
The holocaust
Seas of blood, bury life
Smell your death as it burns
Deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of
Your wide awake nightmare
Wings of pain, reach out for you
His face of death staring down,
Your blood running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of
The mutants he's creating
Pathetic harmless victims
Left to die
Rancid Angel of Death
Flying free

[LEADS: HANNEMAN, KING, HANNEMAN, KING, HANNEMAN]

Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher,
Angel of Death

Angel of Death


2. Piece By Piece

[Lyrics & Music - King]

Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece

You have no choice of life or death
My face you will not see
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
Dismembered destiny

As soon as life has left your corpse
I'll make you part of me
No emotion
Death is all I see

Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece

Bones and blood lie on the ground
Rotten limbs lie dead
Decapitated bodies found
On my wall, your head!

On your trail I close the gap
One more life that soon won't be
No emotion
Your flesh is all I need

I'll send you to your maker
Confront the God you seek
A flash of red upon his your chest
Safety out of reach

(You have no choice of life or death
My face you will not see
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
Dismembered destiny)

(Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
There's only one way out of here
Piece by piece)


3. Necrophobic

[Lyrics & Music - Hanneman & King]

Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain
Limb dissection, amputation, from a mind deranged

Asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair?

Ripping apart
Severing flesh
Gouging eyes
Tearing limb from limb

Experimentation, slow infection, internal decay
Execution, need transfusion, body rots away

Sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs
Skin contortion, bone erosion, your life becomes your fine

Ripping apart
Severing flesh
Gouging eyes
Tearing limb from limb

[LEAD: HANNEMAN, KING]

Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain
Limb dissection, amputation, from a mind deranged

Asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair

Sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs
Skin contortion, bone erosion, your life becomes your fine

Necrophobic can't control the paranoia
Scared to die


4. Altar Of Sacrifice

[Lyrics - King, Music - Hanneman]

Waiting the hour destined to die
Here on the table of hell
A figure in white unknown by man
Approaching the altar of death
High priest awaiting dagger in hand
Spilling the pure virgin blood
Satan's slaughter, ceremonial death
Answer his every command

Death will come easy just close your eyes -
Dream of the friends you'll see
Heavenly failure losing again
Move on to a new form of life

Altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
Confronting the evil you dread
Coalesce into one your shadow and soul
Soon you will meet the undead

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]

(Altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
Confronting the evil you dread
Coalesce into one your shadow and soul
Soon you will meet the undead)

Enter to the realm of Satan!

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]

Blood turning black, the change has begun
Feeling the hatred of all damned in Hell
Flesh starts to burn, twist and deform
Eyes dripping blood realization of death
Transforming of five toes to two
Learn the sacred words of praise, hail Satan

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]

A gift of powers disposed upon you
Use them when you feel the need
Master the forces and powers of Satan
Controlling the creature's instinct
Drawn to the castles that float in the sky
Learn to resist the temptation
Watching the angels sift through the heavens
Endlessly searching for salvation

[LEAD: KING]


5. Jesus Saves

[Lyrics - King, Music - Hanneman, King]

You go to the church, you kiss the cross
You will be saved at any cost
You have your own reality
Christianity
You spend your life just kissing ass
A trait that's grown as time has passed
You think the world will end today
You praise the Lord, it's all you say

Jesus saves, listen to you pray
You think you'll see the pearly gates
When death takes you away

For all respect you cannot lust
In an invisible man you place your trust
Indirect dependency
Eternal attempt at amnesty
He will decide who lives and dies
Depopulate Satanas rise
You will be an accessory
Irreverence and blasphemy

[LEAD: KING]

Jesus saves, no need to pray
The gates of pearl have turned to gold
It seems you've lost your way

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]

Jesus saves, no words of praise
No promised land to take you to
There is no other way

[LEAD: KING]


6. Criminally Insane

[Lyrics & Music - Hanneman & King]

Night will come and I will follow
For my victims, no tomorrow
Make it fast, your time of sorrow
On his trail, I'll make you follow

Quarters for the criminally insane
The sentence read for life I must remain
The path I chose has led me to my grave
To try again I'd have no other way

Quarters for the criminally insane
Escape for me has fast become a game
Soon to be, I'll leave without a trace
Endangered species end the human race

[LEAD: HANNEMAN, KING]

Branded in pain
Marked criminally insane
Locked away and kept restrained
Disapprobation, but what have I done
I have yet only just begun
To take your fuckin' lives!

(Night will come and I will follow
For my victims, no tomorrow
Make it fast, your time of sorrow
On his trail, I'll make you follow)


7. Reborn

[Lyrics - King, Music - Hanneman]

Convicted witch my life will end
At midnight on the stake
My dedicated life was spent
To insubordinate
Secured by lock inside a cell
Imprisoned for no crime
The shackles will be useless
When your life is out of time

Incantation spell gone by
I will see life again
My deals will made eternally
I signed the book of red
My rage will be unleashed again
Burning the next morn
Death means nothing, there is no end
I will be reborn

No gift of exile in my fate
I'll get no amnesty
You can't control my destiny
There is no habitual need
Proclaim my death, to end my wrath
It takes more than one try
Indulge your ineffective curse
I will never die

You think by killing me tonight
My powers will not rise
There'll be nowhere for you to run
When my hatred comes to life
Condemned to fill the prophecy
Allowing no first born
Defy your morbid declaration
Leave you ripped and torn

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]

Count your blessing would be priest
As I burn upon the stake
You'd be forgiven endlessly
But your values are all fake
Forever servant of my Lord
By choice and not submission
Maybe now I've made you wonder
Am I superstition

Incantation spell gone by
I will live again
My deals will made eternally
I signed the book in red
My rage will be unleashed again
Burning the next morn
Death means nothing there is no end
I will be reborn

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]


8. Epidemic

[Lyrics - King, Music - Hanneman, King]

Breeding fast in poverty
Infectious driving dormant seed
Inside your carcass start to mate
Left in charge to dominate
Waiting to unfold
Raging uncontrolled
Adapt a potency
Death machine, infest my corpse to be

Unyielding kings of agony
Test your body chemistry
Pulmonary overthrow
Possession of your inner throne
Invasions quickly override, malicious domineering strike
Flood your veins commit slow death
Deteriorate your makers met

Perpetual demise
On a fast decline
Killing tendency
Epidemic, permanent disease

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]

Incapacitate, fall into your fate
Pain results in screams, bleed internally
Years will pass before it can be cured

[LEAD: KING]


9. Postmortem

[Lyrics & Music - Hanneman]

Funeral held for the depression of man
Holds the key to his own death
Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
Tighten the tourniquet around your neck

Sifting away the debris of hated life
Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
Seeking life beyond your perishment
Repeating words echoing through your mind

Chanting lines of blind witchery
To save yourself from extinction
Wanting to die is your reason to live
New life born from the oppressed

Taste your blood as it trickles through the air
Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
Losing ground, the fate you feel it draws near
Fatality, reality, you await the final call

My sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
Skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
Vessels in my brain carry death until my birth
Come and die with me forever
Share insanity

Do you want to die!

The waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
Turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
Non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
What I am, what I want, I'm only after death


10. Raining Blood

[Lyrics - Haneman, King, Music - Hanneman]

Trapped in purgatory
A lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal
Death will be their acquittance

The sky is turning red
Return to power draws near
Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears
Abolish the rules made of stone

Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above

Awaiting the hour of reprisal
Your time slips away

Raining blood
From a lacerated sky
Bleeding its horror
Creating my structure
Now I shall reign in blood!


11. Aggressive Perfector

[Expanded Edition Bonus Track]

[Lyrics & Music: Hanneman & King]

Follow me, I'll lead the way; your fears will soon overtake
Hide your infinite tears inside, it seeks your smallest break
Screaming as if nothing helps, you press on to survive
Playing out the fantasies of a force that keeps you alive

He'll have you down on your knees
You play his fatal game
He'll satisfy your every need
You'll never be the same

Take my hand, I'll show you how;
You've just one life to live
The road you're on goes straight to hell;
Your life is yours to give
His fantasies of all of you are much too great to see
This world your living is so unreal, perfected just for me

He'll have you down on your knees
You play his fatal game
He'll satisfy your every need
You'll never be the same

1. South Of Heaven

[Lyrics: Araya; Music: Hanneman]

An unforseen future nestled somewhere in time.
Unsuspecting victims no warnings, no signs.
Judgment day the second coming arrives.
Before you see the light you must die.

Forgotten children, conform a new faith,
Avidity and lust controlled by hate.
(The) Never ending search for your shattered sanity,
Souls of Damnation in their own reality.

Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive habitat.

Bastard sons begat your cunting daughters,
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers.
Engreat souls condemned for all eternity,
Obtained by immoral observance a domineering deity.

Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive sabbath.

On and on, south of heaven [x 4]

[LEAD: KING]

The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul.
A force that has lived all eternity.
The never ending search for a truth never told.
The loss of all hope and your dignity.

Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive habitat.

On and on, south of heaven [x 4]

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]


2. Silent Scream

[Lyrics: Araya; Music: Hanneman, King]

Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death.

Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest.

Guidance, it means nothing
In a world of brutal time.

Electric, circus, wild,
Deep in the infants mind.

Silent Scream
Bury the unwanted child.
Beaten and torn
Sacrifice the unborn.

Shattered, adolescent [sings: another child]
Bearer of no name.

Restrained, insane games
Suffer the children condemned.

Scattered, remnants of life,
Murder a time to die.

Pain, sufferaged toyed,
Life's little fragments destroyed.

Silent Scream
Crucify the bastard son.
Beaten and torn
Sanctify lives of scorn.

[LEAD: KING , HANNEMAN]

Life preordained
Humanity maintained.
Extraction termination
Pain's agonizing stain.

Embryonic death,
Embedded in your brain.
Suffocation, strangulation,
Death is fucking you insane.

Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death.

Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest.
Innocence withdrawn in fear.
Fires burning can you hear
Cries in the night.


3. Live Undead

[Lyrics: Araya, King; Music: Hanneman]

Cascaded darkness
Walls close in on me.
Nailed shut but my eyes still see.
Severe anguish as my body evolves.
The pain of life after death it resolves.

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]

Emptiness in twilight's rebirth,
The faint sounds of shoveled earth.
Madness growing as your mind dissolves.
Merely secret in my dreams.

[LEAD: KING]

Night grows cold, twilight's near,
On the edge of madness the wounds are sheared.
Forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass
No spared breath.
Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode.
Dead soul,
Stone cold,
Out into the night.

Voices inside my head
Hold me under.
Voices oppress.
Like roaring thunder.
An echo bouncing inside my brain.
How much can I take of the pain,
The pain!

A war raging deep inside my head,
A split decision that will end with me dead.

You see the agony in my eyes,
Protruding aimless,
I think it's time to die.

[LEAD: KING]

A cannibal's desire feeds the fire
that burns in your head.

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]

Intense pain eats away at your brain,
Thorazine pumping through your veins.

[LEAD: KING]

Death walks inside you,
Smell death around you,
Hell's evil spell takes a soul,
Hear the sound of the bell
Counting off death tolls.

[LEAD: KING]

Laughing as you eternally rot,
Searching for human flesh
And life's blood.

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]

Live Undead.

Dead


4. Behind The Crooked Cross

[Lyrics: Hanneman; Music: Hanneman]

Time melts away in this living inferno,
Trapped by a cause that I once understood.
Feeling a sickness building inside of me,
Who will I really have to answer to.

March on through the rivers of red.
Souls drift, they fill the air.
Forced to fight, behind,
The crooked cross.

Do only what is expected of me,
With no emotions my feelings suppressed.
Blind obedience carries me through it all.
Conscience a word I learned to forget.

March on through the rivers of red.
Flesh burns, it fills the air. (Souls drift, they fill...)
Forced to fight, behind,
The crooked cross.

[LEAD: HANNEMAN, KING, KING, HANNEMAN]

Time melts away in this living inferno,
Trapped by a cause that I once understood.
Blind obedience carries me through it all,
Do only what is expected of me.

March on through the rivers of red.
Souls drift, they fill the air.
Forced to fight, behind,
The crooked cross.


5. Mandatory Suicide

[Lyrics: Araya; Music: Hanneman, King]

Murder at your every foot step.
A child's toy sudden death.
Sniper blazes you thru your knees
Falling down can you feel the heat,
Burn!

Ambushed by the spray of lead
Count the bullet holes in your head.
Offspring sent out to cry,
Living mandatory suicide.
Suicide. [x 4]

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]

Holes burn deep in your chest,
Raked by machine gun fire.
Screaming soul sent out to die,
Living mandatory suicide.
Suicide. [x 4]

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]

[Spoken:]
Lying, dying, screaming in pain.
Begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain.
Mines explode, pain sheers through your brain,
Radical amputation, this is insane.

Fly swatter stakes drive through your chest.
Spikes impale you as you're forced off the crest.
Soldier of misfortune
Hunting with bated breath.

A vile smell, like tasting death.
Dead bodies, dying and wounded
Litter the city streets
Shattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit.
Dying [in] terror,
Blood's cheap, it's everywhere.
Mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line.


6. Ghosts Of War

[Lyrics: King; Music: Hanneman, King]

Fate silent warriors sleeping souls will arise.
Once forgotten soldiers come to life.
Fallen mercenary, dormancy is done,
Not content with wars we never won.

Memories can't ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn.
Rise ghosts of war.

Target assassinate, time of your life has expired.
Hatred victimize, gaze in their eyes as they die.
Violence inflicting of pain, savage morticians deny
Drive the salt in the wound, arouse the subconscious to lie.

(Memories can't ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn.
Rise ghosts of war.)

[LEADS: HANNEMAN, KING, HANNEMAN]

I deal in pain.
All life I drain.
I dominate.
I seal your fate.
I deal in pain.
All life I drain.
Memories can't ignore,
Rise ghost of war.


7. Read Between The Lies

[Lyrics: Araya, King; Music: Hanneman]

Evangelist you claim God speaks through you,
Your restless mouth full of lies gains popularity.
You care not for the old that suffer,
When empty pockets cry from hunger.

Penniless from their generosity,
Sharing their money to quench your greed.
Searching for the answer to their prayers
They cry their last wish of need.
Save me.

His spirit lives and breathes in me.
The almighty transformed to your screen.
The meanings lost in its translation,
No holy words, describe his deception.

You say you'll help us find the lord,
Tell me preacher how do you know
A simple quest for a visible savior,
To lead us through our final prayer.
Save me.

Send your donations,
Contribute to the cause.
Luxuries,
Your righteous reward?

Praise the lord, praise god,
Is what you wish to sell.
There is no heaven without a hell.

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]

In your mind's eye could you truly believe,
That by giving you can save your soul,
Could you be so naive!
You heal the sick,[you] raise the dead,
You blind the congregation
With the things you say.

Religious blackmail a deceit of trust,
That death will come and all will be lost.

Can you hear the serpents call,
Look deep in those deceiving eyes.
Ignore the writing on the wall,
You should read between the lies.

When doubt subsides his honesty,
An inquiry, is it blasphemy?
Impure the soul, that's made to suffer,
No sermons left to hide or cover,
An empty promise, lie unfulfilled,
To steal a dream or get it killed.
They claim your trip to heavens nearby,
You may believe it but satan wouldn't lie.


8. Cleanse The Soul

[Lyrics: Araya, King; Music: Hanneman]

Body that rests before me,
With every dying breath,
Spellbound and gagged,
I commence your flesh to dirt.

Body that lay before me,
In everlasting death.
Entombed in abscess,
To rot and lie stinking in the earth.

[LEAD: KING]

Empty altar awaits its victim
Stained glass windows black.
Candles burn the midnight oil,
Incense fills the night.

Observing trance awaking state
Lying still unknowing.
Reciting the passages of time
Prepare for the impaling.

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]

Death's an art, flesh and earth never part,
A power of the mind.
Death shines on the air of silence,
A ritual of endless time.

Purged of your dead body,
Sacrificed of your life.
Unearthly ritual sealed in fire
Enter the kingdom of desire.

[LEAD: KING]


9. Dissident Aggressor

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected to all

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending
Until I give out my last breath

I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
I know what I am, I'm Berlin


10. Spill The Blood

[Lyrics: Hanneman; Music: Hanneman]

Come walk with me through endless time.
See what has been and what the future sees.
Share the wisdom of the old world that has passed,
Step in a life that's yet to be born.

You spill the blood,
Eternal soul.

I'll show you sights that you would not believe.
Experience pleasures thought unobtained.
At one with evil that has ruled before.
Now smell the stench of immortality.

You spill the blood,
Eternal soul.

[LEAD: HANNEMAN]

Spill your blood, let it run on to me,
Take my hand and let go of your life.
Close your eyes and see what is me,
Raise the chalice, embrace for evermore.

You've spilt the blood.
I'll have your soul.
