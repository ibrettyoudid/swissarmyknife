My Heart Will Go On

Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on

Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go 'til we're gone

Love was when I loved you
One true time I'd hold to
In my life, we'll always go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on (why does the heart go on?)
Once more, you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart and
My heart will go on and on

Falling Into You

[Verse 1]
And in your eyes, I see ribbons of color
I see us inside of each other
I feel my unconscious merge with yours
And I hear a voice say, "What's his is hers"

[Chorus]
I'm falling into you (Falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (Falling into you)
Falling into you

[Verse 2]
I was afraid (I was afraid) to let you in here
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
The walls begin to tumble down
And I can't even see the ground

[Chorus]
I'm falling into you (Falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (Falling into you)
Falling into you
Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are

[Bridge]
Catch me, don't let me drop
Love me, don't ever stop

[Verse 3]
So close your eyes, and let me kiss you
And while you sleep, I will miss you, oh

[Chorus]
I'm falling into you (Falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (Falling into you)
Falling into you
Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are

[Outro]
Falling into you
Falling into you
Falling into you
Hey

River Deep, Mountain High Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When I was a little girl
I had a rag doll
Only doll I've ever owned
Now I love you just the way I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown

[Bridge]
And it gets stronger, in every way
And it gets deeper, let me say
And it gets higher, day by day

[Chorus]
And do I love you? My, oh, my
Yeah, river deep, mountain high
If I lost you, would I cry?
Oh, how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 2]
When you were a young boy
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around?
Well, I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No, I'll never let you down

[Bridge]
'Cause it grows stronger, like a river flows
And it gets bigger, baby, and heaven knows
And it gets sweeter, baby, as it grows
See pop shows near London
Get tickets as low as $10,000

[Chorus]
And do I love you? My, oh, my
Yeah, river deep, mountain high
If I lost you, would I cry?
Oh, how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 3]
I love you, baby, like a flower loves the spring
And I love you, baby, just like Tina loves to sing
And I love you, baby, like a school boy loves his pet
And I love you, baby, river deep, mountain high
Oh yeah, you've gotta believe me
River deep, mountain high

[Outro]
Do I love you? My, oh my, oh baby
River deep, mountain high
If I lost you, would I cry?
Oh, how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

You Make Me Feel (Like a Natural Woman) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Lookin' out on the mornin' rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Oh, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
But your love was the key to my peace of mind

[Chorus]
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman

[Verse 2]
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
And didn't know just what was wrong with me
Oh, till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm livin' for
Cause if I make you happy
I don't need to do more

[Chorus]
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman
See pop shows near London
Get tickets as low as $10,000

[Verse 3]
Oh, baby what you've done to me
You make me feel so good inside
Good inside
And I, I just wanna be close to you
Because you make me feel so alive
Oh, what you've done to me
Close to you because you make me feel so alive
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman

{Outro}
Woman
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman
You make me feel
Oh, baby what you do to me
Can make me feel so good inside
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
Oh, what you've done
Natural woman

I Drove All Night Lyrics

[Intro]
Oh, whoa, da-da-da
Ah-ey

[Verse 1]
I had to escape
The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first
But I was dying to get to you
I was dreaming while I drove
The long straight road ahead, uh-huh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside

[Chorus]
I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright? (Is that alright?)
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright? (Is that alright?)
I drove all night

[Verse 2]
What in this world keeps us from falling apart?
No matter where I go, I hear the beating of our one heart
I think about you when the night is cold and dark, uh-huh, yeah
No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases this feeling between me and you, oh

[Chorus]
I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright? (Is that alright?)
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright? (Is that alright?)
I drove all night

[Bridge]
I taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside

[Outro]
I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright (Is that alright?)
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Is that alright?
I drove all night


[Outro]
(I drove all night) I drove all night
(To get to you) To get to you
(Is that alright?) Is that alright?
(I drove all night) I drove all night
(Crept in your room) Crept in your room
(Is that alright?) Is that alright?
I drove all night

Think Twice Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Don't think I can't feel that there's something wrong
You've been the sweetest part of my life for so long
I look in your eyes, there's a distant light
And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight
This is getting serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us

[Chorus]
Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby think twice

[Verse 2]
Baby think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
For the fire and the faith that was you and me
Babe I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for higher ground
'Cos when you're halfway up, you're always halfway down
But baby this is serious (This is serious)
Are you thinking 'bout you or us

[Chorus]
Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby think twice

[Bridge]
Baby this is serious (This is serious)
Are you thinking 'bout you or us
Baby

[Outro]
Don't say what you're about to say (No no no no)
Look back before you leave my life (Don't leave my life)
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby think twice
Don't do what you're about to do
My everything depends on you (I depend on you)
Whatever it takes, I'll sacrifice
Before you roll those dice (Don't do it baby, oh don't do it baby)
Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life (Don't leave my life)
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby think twice
